Experiments on the 2014 CrabSwerve drive chassis.

Based on the student code FINAL2014 with corrections and experiments incuded.

Not all functions have been checked, corrected or are useful but many have.

The 2 significant issues with the orignal competition code were some confusion of the orientation (CW/CCW) of the joystick, encoders, gyro; and the lack of documentation of what was trying to be accomplished by certain steering/driving functions.

Experiments are included but may have been commented out or just not called as new experiments are added.

This robot code was initially run on the NI cRIO using the Rolling Thunder Eclipse plugin.
